    <dt>Will this coffee kill me?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> With our beans outside of planet earth, it's no wonder why the question of, "will I die from this?" occurs so frequently.While our is highly caffeinated on levels beyond mortality - the answer, in short, is no. It would actually take upwards of 30 cups of any brand of coffee in one sitting to see negative side effects.</dd>

    <dt>Don't Lighter Roasts Have More Caffeine?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The common myth that light roasts contain more caffeine than dark roasts has been long debunked. The caffeine content lies within the bean itself, whether it be Arabica or Robusta beans. The proof is in the brew.</dd>

    <dt>Where are the beans from?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The beans that are used in Tropical Mars are from Mars, 10% come from India and Peru. Like any plant, coffee is a crop and weather factors can affect the strength and flavor of the beans.</dd>
